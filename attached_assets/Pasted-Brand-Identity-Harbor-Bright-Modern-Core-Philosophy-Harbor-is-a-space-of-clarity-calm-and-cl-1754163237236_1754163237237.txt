Brand Identity: Harbor (Bright & Modern)
Core Philosophy: Harbor is a space of clarity, calm, and clean air. The brand identity is built on principles of minimalism and light. It evokes the feeling of a clear morning, with bright, indirect sunlight and the fresh scent of coastal sage. It’s a modern, safe space that feels open, breathable, and optimistic.
1. The Bright & Clean Color Palette
We are replacing the warm, earthy neutrals with crisp, cool-toned neutrals. This will make your primary green, Coastal Sage, feel more vibrant and contemporary.
Primary: Coastal Sage
#7aa095 (Unchanged)
Usage: Remains the heart of the brand. Use it for all primary actions, interactive elements, highlights, and key illustrations. It provides a splash of calming, natural color in a clean space.


Primary Background: Cloud White
#f8f9fa
Usage: This is your new primary background. It’s a very light, cool-toned gray that is significantly brighter and cleaner than the previous "Linen White." It provides a sense of spaciousness and modernity without the clinical starkness of pure white.
Secondary Background / Cards: Vapor Gray
#e9ecef
Usage: A soft, cool gray used for content containers, cards, and dividers. It creates a subtle, clean separation of elements and pairs perfectly with Cloud White.
Primary Text: Charcoal
#212529
Usage: This is your new text color. It’s a dark, near-black charcoal that provides crisp, clear contrast against the bright backgrounds. It makes typography feel sharp and modern, significantly improving readability and perceived freshness.
Accents & States (The Green Family)
Mint Haze: #d1e2de
A lighter, airier tint of Coastal Sage. Use for gentle hover states, subtle alerts, or background patterns.
Deep Seafoam: #5c8078
A darker, richer shade of Coastal Sage. Use for secondary buttons, active form fields, or text links to create hierarchy within the green family.
Optional Accent: Calm Sky Blue
#90b0d1
Usage: To be used sparingly as a tertiary accent. This soft, reassuring blue can highlight positive achievements, success notifications, or gentle guidance prompts. It complements the green beautifully and reinforces the "Harbor" theme (water, sky).

2. Typography
The excellent font pairing of Poppins and Lora is maintained, but its application is sharpened by the new color palette.
Color Application (Updated):
All headings and body copy should now use Charcoal (#212529). This will make the text feel exceptionally crisp and legible against the Cloud White background.
Text links can use Deep Seafoam (#5c8078) to stand out from the body copy while staying within the calming palette.
3. Logo & Iconography
The clean palette gives the logo and icons a more modern, tech-forward feel that aligns with the "Gemini/Claude" sense of innovation.
Logo: Rendered in Charcoal on a Cloud White background, the logo will look sharp, clean, and confident.
Icons: Icons should be rendered in Charcoal. When active or hovered, they can change to Coastal Sage for a clear, intuitive user experience.
5. UI/UX & Interaction Example
This new system translates into a UI that feels responsive, clean, and effortless to use.
Screen Layout: The entire background is a breathable Cloud White. A central content area or sidebar might use Vapor Gray to gently frame the main content.
Call to Action: A primary button ("Begin Today's Journal") has a solid Coastal Sage background with crisp Cloud White text. It looks inviting and clear.
User Input: A text field has a light Vapor Gray border. When the user clicks into it, the border glows with Deep Seafoam, and the text they type appears in sharp Charcoal.
Success Message: After saving an entry, a small, unobtrusive banner appears at the top. It has a Mint Haze background, with a small checkmark icon in Coastal Sage and text in Charcoal, saying "Your entry has been saved."
This refreshed branding system maintains the core goal of being calm and safe while feeling modern, bright, and invigoratingly clean. It creates a space that feels both trustworthy and forward-thinking.
