1. The Vibrant & Clear Color Palette
We are integrating your new, more vibrant teal into the clean, cool-toned neutral foundation. This creates a high-contrast, professional, and uplifting aesthetic.
Primary: Clearwater Teal
#32808c
Usage: This is the new star of the show. As your primary color, it should be used for all major calls-to-action, interactive icons, active navigation states, and key brand moments. It’s vibrant enough to draw the eye without causing anxiety.
Neutrals: The Bright Foundation (Unchanged)
Primary Background: Cloud White (#f8f9fa)
Secondary Background / Cards: Vapor Gray (#e9ecef)
Primary Text: Charcoal (#212529)
Usage: This clean, modern, and cool-toned trio remains the perfect foundation. It allows the new Clearwater Teal to pop, ensuring the interface feels bright, airy, and exceptionally readable, as you requested.
Accents & States (The New Teal Family)
Light Accent: Aqua Mist
#cce5e8
Usage: A very light, airy tint of the primary teal. Perfect for subtle hover effects, success message backgrounds, or to highlight a specific section in a delicate way.
Dark Accent: Deep Teal
#256069
Usage: A darker, richer shade of the primary. Excellent for secondary buttons (like "ghost" buttons), text links, and borders on active input fields, providing clear visual hierarchy.
Optional Accent: Calm Sky Blue (Unchanged)
#90b0d1
Usage: This soft, reassuring blue remains a valuable tool for tertiary highlights. It’s harmonious with Clearwater Teal and can be used for non-critical notifications or illustrative accents to add a layer of serenity.

2. Typography
The friendly and readable font system is maintained, now powered by the new color scheme for greater clarity and impact.
Fonts: Poppins (Headings) and Lora (Body) remain.
Color Application:
All primary text continues to use Charcoal (#212529) for maximum contrast and a modern feel.
Text links should now use Deep Teal (#256069), making them clearly clickable while fitting perfectly into the new palette.
3. Logo & Iconography
The execution remains clean and modern, now with a more energetic touch.
Logo: Rendered in Charcoal on a Cloud White background for a crisp, timeless look.
Icons: Standard icons use Charcoal. When hovered over or active, they should transform to Clearwater Teal (#32808c). This provides immediate, satisfying feedback to the user.
5. UI/UX & Interaction Example
Here's how the refreshed UI will feel in action:
The Scene: A user lands on their dashboard. The background is a clean Cloud White. Their main content feed is on cards with a subtle Vapor Gray background.
Call to Action: A prominent button invites them to "Start a New Reflection." The button's background is Clearwater Teal with text in Cloud White. It feels inviting and clear.
Interaction: As the user hovers over navigation links (like "My Harbor," "Resources"), the Charcoal text smoothly transitions to Clearwater Teal.
Confirmation: After they save their reflection, a confirmation message appears: "Your thoughts are safely anchored." The message box has a soft Aqua Mist background, giving gentle, positive feedback that doesn't startle the user.
This revised system successfully injects energy and vibrancy while honoring the core mission of creating a calm, safe, and modern space for your users.
