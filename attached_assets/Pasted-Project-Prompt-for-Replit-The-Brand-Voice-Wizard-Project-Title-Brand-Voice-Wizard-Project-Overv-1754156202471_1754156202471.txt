Project Prompt for Replit: The "Brand Voice Wizard"
Project Title: Brand Voice Wizard

Project Overview:
Build a multi-page web application called the "Brand Voice Wizard." This wizard will be a guided, step-by-step process to help users define, document, and save one or more brand voice profiles. The application must be intuitive, save progress automatically between sessions, and feature a dashboard for managing multiple profiles.

Core User Stories & UX Principles:

Multi-Profile Management: Users must be able to create, view, edit, and delete multiple brand voice profiles from a central dashboard.

Step-by-Step Wizard: The form must be broken down into multiple pages/sections to prevent user overwhelm.

Automatic Progress Saving: All inputs must be saved to the database automatically as the user navigates between pages or closes the session.

Flexibility & No Pressure: No fields are mandatory except for the initial profile setup. Users must be explicitly told they can complete the wizard at their own pace and leave fields blank.

Clear Guidance: Helper text should be provided directly within the form fields as placeholder text to guide the user's input.

Technical Specifications
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a clean, modern, and responsive design.

Backend: Python (Flask) or Node.js (Express).

Database: Use the built-in Replit DB for simplicity. The database schema must support a one-to-many relationship between a user/company and their voice profiles. All fields related to the wizard questions must be nullable.
