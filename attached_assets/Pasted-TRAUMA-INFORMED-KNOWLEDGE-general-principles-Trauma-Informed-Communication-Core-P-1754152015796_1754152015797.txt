    Trauma-Informed Communication Core Principles:

    1. Person-First Language: Always put the person before their experience or condition. Say "person who experienced trauma" rather than "trauma victim."

    2. Strengths-Based Approach: Focus on resilience, capabilities, and potential rather than deficits or problems.

    3. Cultural Sensitivity: Recognize and respect diverse cultural backgrounds, beliefs, and experiences.

    4. Empowerment and Choice: Provide options and respect individual autonomy in decision-making.

    5. Safety and Trust: Create psychologically and physically safe environments through consistent, predictable communication.

    6. Collaboration: Work with rather than for people, recognizing their expertise in their own experiences.

    Key Language Considerations:
    - Use "person-first" language consistently
    - Avoid stigmatizing terms like "crazy," "broken," or "damaged"
    - Choose empowering words like "survivor" over "victim" when appropriate
    - Be specific and clear rather than vague
    - Acknowledge strengths and resilience explicitly
